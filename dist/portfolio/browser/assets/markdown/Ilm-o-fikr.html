  With the closing of libraries due to coronavirus, I decided to work on my
  side-project app of providing pdf versions of Urdu books from the library.
</p>
<p>
  An application was needed which would contain all the basic feature of crud
  function for books with an advanced role-based authentication system and a
  comment rating system.
</p>
<p>
  I worked on the application using angular as frontend and express as backend.
  Passport js was used for authentication.
