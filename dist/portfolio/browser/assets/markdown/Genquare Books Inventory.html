  Genquare wanted to increase its productivity to take an even bigger chunk of
  the on-demand books market. As its customer base and selling platforms
  continued to grow, managing all the inventories at different platforms became
  a nightmare. Genquare decided to create a central inventory system that would
  manage all the business aspects in a single place.

  I worked with Genquare from the beginning to create a web as well as a desktop
  application. It was decided to manage the inventory with the use of a barcode
  scanning system. I created the application with angular as frontend, express
  as backend, and electron for the desktop application.

  It has been decided that an invoice management system and customer database
  are also to be integrated into the application.
